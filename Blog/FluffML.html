                <p>Just a quick blog post today. Man I work with e621's API too much. Anywho, here's a fun project I made while learning ML.NET: A way to predict if you're going to like a post from e621! I'm pretty happy with how this turned out, even if it's not always super acurate. It'll depend highly on what a user likes/dislikes, and how many posts they like/dislike. I don't plan on doing too much with this, as it was just an experiment to learn ML.NET. It's open source on github, so if you want to tinker with it or take it places feel free!</p>
                <h2 id="Fluff-ML">How does this work?</h2>
                <p>The application will take you through the process of building and using your model. Here's a step by step on what you'll do, why, and some things to consider before starting.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Login to e621</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In order to get your likes, your username and API key are required.</li>
                        <li>You can choose to keep your login info ready each time you open the app, or to forget it on app close.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </br>
                    <li>Load posts from your likes and dislikes, and save them to disk</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your model will be trained to classify images into two labels, liked or disliked, and the model will guess which one any image is.</li>
                        <li>This requires we save images to the disk, yes even the ones you disliked. Keep that in mind.</li>
                        <li>Images are saved as sample quality, cropped into squares.</li>
                        <li>This works best when you have lots of likes and dislikes, and when you have around the same number of both. So if you aren't happy with your model, try to like and dislike some more images.</li>
                        <li>Depending on how many likes / dislikes you have and your connection speed, this can take awhile.</li>
                        <li>If you wanna keep updating your model, keep these images on your disk! The post loader skips over images you already have, so you can more quickly update your dataset.</li>

                    </ul>
                    </br>
                    <li>Build your model</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You'll now get to train your model and you know what that means, more waiting!</li> 
                        <li>This step can take as long as you set, but longer is usually better, especially with larger datasets.</li>
                        <li>When done, the model is reusable. So next time you open the app you can easily bypass the first two steps.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </br>
                    <li>Predict</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your model is now ready for use, so let's use it! Fluff ML will download posts from e621 and predict if you'd like to see them or not!</li>
                        <li>You can choose what tag to search, and how many posts to get</li>
                        <li>You'll only see images it thinks you'll like!</li>
                    </ul>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>This was a fun project to work on, despite Mircosoft's docs on ML.NET being outdated half the time. I'll definitely do more ML work when ML.NET gets deep learning (hopefully later this year!)</p>
