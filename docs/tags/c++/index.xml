        <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a fun project I worked on to help me prototype console tools quicker and allow me to make them look and feel nice. I worked on it from Sept 2020 to Feb 2021. It was made for windows, and while some features might work on other operating systems a few will certainly not, such as the cursor menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full documentation is available as well as a demo application that showcases many of the features. You can find both of those things on the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/EpsiRho/UIKit&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Github Repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
