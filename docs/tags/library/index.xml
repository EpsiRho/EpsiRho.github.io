        <title>E621 C# Library</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This was made while I was learning REST API development for the first time. I picked the e621 API for the funny and because it&amp;rsquo;s auth and rate-limits were relaxed and easy to start with. This later went on to be used in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://epsirho.com/p/fluff&#34; &gt;Fluff&lt;/a&gt;, which was my first attempt at a good looking UI application. I hosted it on nuget to make it easier to use in my projects, and for some reason it has 11k+ downloads xP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the code on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/EpsiRho/E621-C-Sharp-Api-Wrapper&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and the built library on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.nuget.org/packages/e6API_EpsiRho&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;nuget&lt;/a&gt;. Documentation for this is incomplete and I&amp;rsquo;ll likely not revisit it!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a fun project I worked on to help me prototype console tools quicker and allow me to make them look and feel nice. I worked on it from Sept 2020 to Feb 2021. It was made for windows, and while some features might work on other operating systems a few will certainly not, such as the cursor menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full documentation is available as well as a demo application that showcases many of the features. You can find both of those things on the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/EpsiRho/UIKit&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Github Repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
