A beautiful, native windows app for e926/e621! View, search, and download posts submitted by other users, and submit your own.

This was a fun project I used to deep dive into learning UWP and making better UIs. It got pretty far along, but I'll likely no longer be updating it. It does still mostly work despite a few bugs, I may go fix them at some point but I don't plan to. I'm pretty proud of the result, especially the custom control behavior I made for the upload page.

If you want to check this out, it's availible on [GitHub](https://github.com/EpsiRho/Fluff) and the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NJRHG6FVKL9?rtc=1&hl=en-us&gl=US). Don't worry, it starts in safe mode! You have to enable NSFW content in the settings if that's what you're looking for :P
