This was made while I was learning REST API development for the first time. I picked the e621 API for the funny and because it's auth and rate-limits were relaxed and easy to start with. This later went on to be used in [Fluff](/p/fluff), which was my first attempt at a good looking UI application. I hosted it on nuget to make it easier to use in my projects, and for some reason it has 11k+ downloads xP

You can find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/EpsiRho/E621-C-Sharp-Api-Wrapper) and the built library on [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/e6API_EpsiRho). Documentation for this is incomplete and I'll likely not revisit it!
