I'm 21 years old, male, and live in the US. Currently a junior in college, studying for a degree in Information Technology. I love to write software apps and tools. Usually motivated by the desire for some software to exist or to be better than existing solutions.

I'm proficient in C# and know how to use Microsoft's UWP/WASDK and ASP.NET frameworks. I have also worked in C/C++ and Python(but I hate python).
