This was the first real app I developed. I started the project because at the time, Discord's upload limit was 8mb and that was never enough to send files to my friends. So I created horizon to give me infinite upload limit and allow easy transfers to my contacts.

Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/EpsiRho/Horizon?tab=readme-ov-file) or the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NLF1LS7Q6J6?hl=en-US&gl=US).
