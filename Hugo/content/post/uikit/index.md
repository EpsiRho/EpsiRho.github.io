This was a fun project I worked on to help me prototype console tools quicker and allow me to make them look and feel nice. I worked on it from Sept 2020 to Feb 2021. It was made for windows, and while some features might work on other operating systems a few will certainly not, such as the cursor menu.

Full documentation is available as well as a demo application that showcases many of the features. You can find both of those things on the [Github Repo](https://github.com/EpsiRho/UIKit).
